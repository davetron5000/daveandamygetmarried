As mentioned in our <a href="<%= wedding_expect_url %>">schedule of events</a>, on Friday, after the beach party, guests are encouraged to visit the <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g147326-d147796-Reviews-Bioluminescent_Mosquito_Bay-Isla_de_Vieques_Puerto_Rico.html">Bioluminescent Bay</a>.  This is a "must-see".  Amy and I went to one on the mainland of Puerto Rico and it was <strong>amazing</strong>; the one in Vieques is supposed to be <strong>far</strong> better.

We'll post more info as we have it on reserving trips for the bio-bay.  You don't want to miss out!
